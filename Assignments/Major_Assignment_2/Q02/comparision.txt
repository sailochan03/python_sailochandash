Comparison between Iterative and Recursive josephus function.

Though the time complexity of both the functions are equal i.e. O(n), but still there are some other factors which makes recursive function less efficient than iterative ones.

1. Space complexity : Recursive function creates new layer to stack frame, which consumes more memory. For n number of recursive calls, it creates O(n) space complexity, whereas iterative function takes O(1) space.

2. Function call overhead : Each recursive call involves more overhead because, it has to push and pop function's context again and again onto and from the call stack frame.
